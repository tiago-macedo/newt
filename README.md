## What is this?

A simple but effective, offline-capable homepage. It allows you to jot down notes, which are saved when the tab or browser is closed. If the notes are in Markdown, they can be rendered!

## Why the name?

Initially I thought this was ging to be a new-tab page ("new tab", "newt", get it?), then I realized that when you open multiple instances of newt, they don't sync. Still works well as an inital page though.

## How does it work?

- Your text is saved locally using [`localStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage).
- Markdown is rendered using [Marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked).

## Next steps

Not in any specific order:
- Add options panel
- Custom colors
- Custom fonts
- Autosave periodically?
